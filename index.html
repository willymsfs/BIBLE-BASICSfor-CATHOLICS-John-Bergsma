            <h3><b>Introduction: It All Starts with a Covenant</b></h3>
            <p>The book introduces the Bible's central theme: the covenant. A covenant is not merely a contract but a sacred family bond God establishes with humanity. The author explains that salvation history unfolds through a series of six major covenants, each mediated by a key figure on a mountain. These mediators are Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and Jesus. Understanding these covenants is the key to seeing the "big picture" of the Bible and how it forms one unified story of God's plan to make us part of His divine family.</p>

            <h3><b>Chapter 1: Setting the Son in the Garden</b></h3>
            <h4><b>The Covenant with Adam</b></h4>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p><b>Short Notes:</b> This chapter explains that the six-day creation story in Genesis is structured like the building of a temple, with the universe as a cosmic temple for God's worship. The seventh day, the Sabbath, is the pinnacle of this creation. Adam is created in God's "image and likeness," which signifies he is a son of God. He is given five key roles: son, king, priest, prophet, and bridegroom. These roles define the purpose of human life: to live in a filial relationship with God, exercise dominion over sin, offer our lives as a sacrifice, speak God's truth, and enter into a spousal communion with Him.</p>

                    <p><b>Short Notes:</b> After Adam and Eve's fall, humanity descends into wickedness, culminating in the story of the "Sons of God" and the "Daughters of Men." God hits the reset button with a flood, an act of re-creation. Noah, a new Adam, is saved. After the flood, Noah lands on Mount Ararat, a new holy mountain, and offers a sacrifice. God establishes a covenant with Noah and all creation, marked by the sign of the rainbow. This covenant renews the blessings of the Adamic covenant, though imperfections now exist in the relationship between humanity and the animal kingdom.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p><b>Short Notes:</b> Humanity falls again, symbolized by the Tower of Babel. God calls one man, Abram (later Abraham), to restore blessing to all nations. God makes three promises to him: a great nation, a great name, and a universal blessing. These promises are elevated to covenant status in three separate ceremonies. The final and most dramatic is the binding of Isaac on Mount Moriah. Isaac, carrying the wood for his own sacrifice, is a prefigurement of Christ. Because of Abraham's and Isaac's faith, God swears an oath to bless the entire world through Abraham's "seed."</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p><b>Short Notes:</b> Abraham's descendants become numerous in Egypt but are enslaved. God calls Moses to liberate them. After the ten plagues, a battle against the gods of Egypt, Israel is freed. On Mount Sinai, God establishes a covenant to make Israel His "first-born son," a "royal priesthood" and a holy nation. He gives them the Ten Commandments as family rules. However, Israel immediately breaks the covenant with the golden calf incident. The covenant is renewed, but with additional penitential laws. Israel's subsequent rebellions in the wilderness show their inability to live up to the covenant.</p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p><b>Short Notes:</b> After centuries of struggle under judges, Israel demands a king. Their first king, Saul, fails. God then chooses David, a man after His own heart. David unites the kingdom, establishes Jerusalem (Zion) as its capital, and reforms worship. God makes a covenant with David on Mount Zion, promising him a son who will build a temple, be the Son of God, and rule over a kingdom forever. This covenant elevates the promises made to Abraham and transfers the sonship rejected by the nation of Israel to the Davidic king.</p>

                    <p><b>Short Notes:</b> David's son, Solomon, builds the Temple, marking the high point of the Old Testament. However, his later sins lead to the kingdom's division and eventual exile. During this decline, God sends prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. They foretell destruction but also promise a "New Covenant." This future covenant will not be like the broken Mosaic one; it will be written on the heart, bring forgiveness of sins, and feature a restored Davidic king. It is described as a "covenant of peace" that will restore humanity to an Eden-like state through a new Temple and an outpouring of God's Spirit.</p>

                    <p><b>Short Notes:</b> This chapter shows Jesus as the fulfillment of all previous covenants. He is the true Son of David and Son of Abraham. As the New Adam, he embodies the roles of son, king, priest, prophet, and bridegroom. At the Last Supper, Jesus inaugurates the New Covenant in his blood. This Eucharistic covenant is the ultimate fulfillment of the prophecies. The cross on Calvary is the new Mount Zion, and from Jesus' pierced side flow blood and water—the sacraments of the Eucharist and Baptism—which pour out the Holy Spirit upon the Church. Through these sacraments, we are made children of God, fulfilling the goal of all salvation history.</p>
